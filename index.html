							<p>Gru, a criminal mastermind with the goal of becoming an acknowledged villain, planned to steal the moon and adopted three girls to use as pawns for his plan. He changed throughout the film as the love of his three daughters affected him greatly. </p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>This movie is one of the best masterpieces, an easy 5/5. It is a great show for children to watch as it has fun adventures, good comedy, interesting characters, and shows how children can love their parents, blood-related or not, very much.</p>

							<p>Being a father of three, Gru, the world's greatest villain, quit in order to raise and provide for his children, Margo, Agnes, and Edith. The Anti-Villain League, an organization dedicated to fighting evil, comes calling. The AVL sends Gru on a mission to capture the perpetrator of a spectacular heist, for who would be better than the world's greatest ex-villain to capture the individual who seeks to take his place as the world's greatest villain.</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>I rate the movie another solid 5/5. The story and pacing was great and it was fun seeing Gru's jounrey to stop El Macho, who tried stealing his minions and title, while beeing assisted by his minions and even his daughters throughout the show.</p>

							<p>The mischievous Minions hope that Gru will return to a life of crime after the new boss of the Anti-Villain League fires him. Instead, Gru decides to remain retired and travel to Freedonia to meet his long-lost twin brother for the first time. The reunited siblings soon find themselves in an uneasy alliance to take down the elusive Balthazar Bratt, a former 1980s child star who seeks revenge against the world.</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>I rate Despicable Me 3 yet another 5/5 as the plot and characters never get boring. The movie was a good watch as it introduced 2 new fun characters, Gru's twin brother and a new villain, Balthazar Bratt. It was entertaining to watch them stop the former child star with his whole group and including his new member, his twin brother.</p>
